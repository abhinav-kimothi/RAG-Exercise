# Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## About This Repository

Welcome to the **Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** excercise repository! This repository contains materials and exercises designed for students enrolled in the **Artificial Intelligence: Generative AI, Cloud, and MLOps (online)** course.

## Course Information

- **Course:** Artificial Intelligence: Generative AI, Cloud, and MLOps (online)
- **Topic:** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. While LLMs have vast parametric memory, they are limited in terms of accuracy, recency, and factual consistency. RAG improves their performance by enabling dynamic access to non-parametric memory (e.g., external documents, knowledge bases, or databases) and integrating relevant information into responses.

### Topics Covered in this repository:

- Indexing Pipeline
    - Data Loading
    - Chunking (or Data Splitting)
    - Embeddings (or Data Transformation)
    - Storage (Vector Databases)

- Generation Pipeline
    - Search & Retrieval
    - Prompt Augmentation
    - LLM Generation

- RAG Evaluation using RAGAs Framework
    - Synthetic Dataset Generation
    - Calculation of Evaluation Metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code and exercises, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.13.2+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinav-kimothi/RAG-Exercise.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RAG Exercise
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Store your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Add your API key inside `.env`:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
   - Ensure your scripts load the environment variables using `dotenv`:
     ```python
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     import os
     load_dotenv()
     openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
     ```
7. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
